## The Client's Organization and its Mission and Goals

### Introduction

Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), is a unit of National Park Service 
The National Monument first began part of National Register of Historic places in the year 1966.
The National Monument 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County and Nebraska. This site is now one among the most successfully claimed acres claimed under Homestead Act.
HOME allowed qualified people  to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation and improving the property in every possible way. As result of this act more than 270 acres of land was turned to individuals volunteering to take of the land. This led to drastic changes in the land which was eventually needed.
The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking tour of the interactive museum of American homesteading.
Homestead Act holds one of the greater significance for westward expansion of the United States. It allowed  a fair chance to any mankind to claim a land for free in exchange of taking care of it keeping it free from contamination, persuading people to take the best care of it.
The Homestead Act brought far reaching effects on the landscape and in the lives of the people.

To raise concerns regarding water quality HOME monitored aquatic invertebrates which started in the year 1996. The quality of the water was measured against the following factors:-
temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, turbidity, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli). Most of the factors met the standards. However, few of the factors like phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria were found to be very high. Summary data showing metric for phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria, indicated that the water quality is not appropriate and not biologically supported .Thereby, HOME decided to protect and manage the in-stream habitats.
	
### History and Mission

Homestead Act has been one of the most important legislation in the United States. The very first Homestead was claimed in the Brownville, Nebraska by a resident of Ohio name Daniel Freeman in the year 1863.He is the first homesteader in the nation. Daniel served more than 1000 acres and became one of the prominent resident of Gage County. He proposed the idea of memorizing the place he lived in, on his name. Soon after his death the residents of Beatrice started the agenda of preserving his homestead as National park. Initially the proposal got rejected by the officials but in the year 1934,the resident of Beatrice organized National Homestead Park Association to continue the deed as performed by the Daniel.
The Association could not do much due to funds issue and soon after the America entered into World War || the park visitation and development was suspended.
However, in the year 1950, National park service (NPS) acquired the park and built the visitor center. Gradually there were some positive progress towards the development and in the year 1981, the National Monument had five permanent employees, one part-time and few seasonal employees.
In the 1970’s and 1980’s seasonal rangers demonstrated the history of the Homestead Act. By the early 1990’s, the Homestead Act began to move to other states in the country.

The mission of the organization is to protect and preserve the cultural and natural resources of National Park System. They also believe that it is our responsibility to protect the resources we have today for our next generation. The services extends with other collaborative partners’ to conserve the natural and cultural resources and recreating outdoor across the country 

### Goals

The ultimate goal of the entire Homestead Act is providing  free land to people in exchange of asking them to cultivating the land to its best. This agenda helped both mankind and the resources around us. People received land for free to live in and at the same time our natural resources, our land and water habitats were protected from further contamination. So many families and immigrants flooded more than 10 percent of the land in US to achieve the ultimate Homestead goal and fulfil the American dream. The goal is to achieve diverse settlement, agricultural benefits and huge advancement in the field of agriculture. Building the nature, renewing our resources to the best for the mankind and future generations to live in.

## The Study Organism and Phenomenon
Water is essential to all life on Earth. In fact, water covered about three fourth of the Earth’s surface, however, freshwater only contribute to a tiny fraction of that amount. Additionally, freshwater supports most living things on Earth which makes it extremely important to keep the source of life safe and clean.

In 1972, the U.S. government introduced the Clean Water Act (CWA) to conserve the quality of surface water. This act was introduced to make sure that all sources of surface water like lakes, streams, and rivers are regulated. From this point onward, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the water quality standards and requirements. For example, the EPA set the threshold for the acceptable amount of pollutants and wastewater standards for the industry. The CWA prohibited the release of any pollutant wastewater into the surface water unless a permit was provided.

Acknowledge the importance of water quality, many park rangers and water quality professionals have been monitoring the quality of surface water throughout the country. By monitoring water quality, the researchers can identify specific contaminations, trends, and whether the water meets EPA standards. To identify contaminations, the researchers need to look at various chemical constituents like phosphorus, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen. Also, the researchers need to look at some other components like the streamflow, temperature, pH level, turbidity, total solids, conductivity, total alkalinity, and Fecal bacteria. The combinations of all these measurements help pinpoint the source of the contamination. For instance, if the source of the contamination is from industrial discharge, the researchers can expect to have unusual measurements on the temperature, the conductivity, the total solids, the toxics, and the pH level. In general, the water temperature from upstream to downstream shouldn’t change too drastically so it would be a good signal to let the researchers know that the water might be contaminated.

The flow of a surface water stream has high impacts on the living organisms and inhabitants. To illustrate, a big water stream with a high discharge rate will have more capacity to dilute wastewater than a small water stream with a low discharge rate. Moreover, by studying the flow of a stream, the researchers will be able to identify the kinds of living organisms live in that stream. To measure the streamflow is to calculate the movement of water over a specific area over a set time.

Besides water, oxygen is another important element that supports all life on Earth. However, unlike photosynthesis, water produces and consumes oxygen in its unique way. For example, a water stream will gain oxygen from the surrounding environment and dissolve through various chemical reactions that utilize oxygen. By measuring dissolved oxygen, the researchers can predict the trend of migration from living organisms when the dissolved oxygen levels are low. Other variables, such as temperature has a direct impact on the dissolved oxygen level since cold water can hold more oxygen.

Like dissolved oxygen, the temperature has a huge effect on the rate of biological and chemical processes. Some aquatic organisms like trout and salmon prefer lower water temperature, therefore, an increase in water temperature would likely lead to a lower population of those organisms. Many factors can cause temperature change include weather, industrial wastewater discharges, sewage water, groundwater inflows, and the dimensions of the stream.

Similar to temperature, pH level and total alkalinity link to the rate of biological and chemical processes. The appropriate pH level for most aquatic organisms is ranging from 6.5 to 8.0. With a low pH level, the water stream becomes acidic which will produce a toxic environment to aquatic organisms. The sources of contamination can come from many sources like acid rain, mineral rocks, or industrial wastewater discharges. With total alkalinity, it shows the capacity of water to neutralized acids. Therefore, by measuring the total alkalinity, the researchers can identify the sensitivity of water stream to acid inputs and its ability to neutralize acidic contaminations.

Turbidity is another measurement of water quality which focusing on the clarity of the water stream. By looking at the material suspended in water like soil particles (clay, silt, and sand) and other particles, the researchers can monitor the passage of light that goes through the water hence recognize the water turbidity. High turbidity leads to an increase in water temperature which ultimately reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen.

Other chemical elements that have a huge impact on water quality are phosphorus and nitrogen. In addition, phosphorus and nitrates (another form of nitrogen) are essential nutrients for the growth of aquatic plants and animals. Therefore, an increase in phosphorus and nitrates would offset the natural balance by boosting the growth of plant and algae which will lower the dissolved oxygen. By monitoring the phosphorus and nitrates levels, the researchers will be able to foresee the disturbance of the natural balance.

Another way to monitor water quality is to measure the conductivity of the water stream. To do so, the researchers need to test the ability of water to conduct electricity by looking at the presence of inorganic dissolved solids (calcium, sodium, etc.) and organic compounds like (oil, alcohol, phenol, and sugar). Moreover, if the water stream is contaminated with oil or phenol, the water conductivity will be lower since these organic compounds are not great at conducting electrical current.

Finally, the researchers need to look at fecal bacteria which is an important indicator of sewage contamination since these bacteria are present in human and animal feces. This type of contamination has a huge impact on human health risk if not resolve quickly. The sources of fecal bacteria can come from wastewater treatment plants, domestic and wild animal manure, or wastewater from a farm.

## The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support

The cub creek water quality not only impacts the aquatic species but also the human.  Poor quality of water always affects the nearby land which is used for agricultural productions of corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa. Now a days water quality is degrading due to many reasons. One of the main reason is Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) which is a bacteria normally live in the intestines of human and animal. E. coli can get in the water in many ways for example through sewage, rainwater, industrial wastage, etc. These bacteria cannot be seen by open eyes and with the use of microscope only we can see it. The cub creek is connected to a large Tuttle creek water which contains three-fourths drainage of Nebraska. The Tuttle creek lake water flows towards the Kansas river and this river provides public drinking water to the city. That’s the main reason we are evaluating water quality before the problems become bigger. Our first two research questions are related to this concern.

 * Does season or temperature affect the amount of E.coli? (Winter vs. summer?)
 * Does precipitation affect the amount of E.coli? (Sewage water?)

Cub creek collects water from many sources e.g. - rainwater. In a basic/normal water, pH value should be pH>7. But, in acidic water pH value is pH<7. This is also an important measurement in water quality as it determines the solubility and biological availability of chemicals. Aquatic life depends on the pH value. They cannot survive in acidic water. our two research questions are related to this concern. 
 
 * Does precipitation (rainy season) affect the pH level? (Acid rain? Water flowing from the street?)
 * Does precipitation affect water conductivity? (Pollution water flowing in?
 
To predict a good analysis using the given set of data, it is important to know which data affect the analysis. The below questions are of concern by the research team.
 
 * What factors affect the water quality the most (Solved using Multiple Regression approach)?
 * What models can we try to find the relationship between water quality and other parameters in the given dataset?
 * What parameters are dependent and which ones are independent?
 * Does time(HH:MM: SS) affect Float test 1 to float test 5?
 * Could you please clarify about the sites NEGP and WGP? What does it stand for and how water flows in these four sites north, west, NEGP, and WGP? 

The analysis can help to determine which people should be offered free land for cultivating. The decisions and actions that can be taken based on the analysis will help to determine how to optimize resource usage. To prevent from land and natural resources from contamination analysis will help to monitor lands and determine when and whom to offer. The analysis could help find out what are the factors which affect the amount of E.coli. Based on analytics and finding out the right combination can help us do better cultivating.  Finding the water quality factors and other related parameters can help us give more information and help people do better cultivation.
The detailed study will help for furture planning and find the best ways to get better result from cultivation.There are lot of factors which affects cultivation, the results and analysis can help to improve cultivation. The project focuses on using the available data and determine the factors which affect water and find out how to improve the current process.
