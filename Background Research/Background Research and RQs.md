# Background Research Report
 The background research for the project is based on the following four section:-
 *  The client’s organization and its mission and goals.
 *  The research questions we are planning to focus.
 *  The study organism or phenomenon.
 *  The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support.

## The Client's Organization and its Mission and Goals

* Introduction

Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), is a unit of National Park Service 
The National Monument first began part of National Register of Historic places in the year 1966.
The National Monument 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County and Nebraska. This site is now one among the most successfully claimed acres claimed under Homestead Act.
HOME allowed qualified people  to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation and improving the property in every possible way. As result of this act more than 270 acres of land was turned to individuals volunteering to take of the land. This led to drastic changes in the land which was eventually needed.
The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking tour of the interactive museum of American homesteading.
Homestead Act holds one of the greater significance for westward expansion of the United States. It allowed  a fair chance to any mankind to claim a land for free in exchange of taking care of it keeping it free from contamination, persuading people to take the best care of it.
The Homestead Act brought far reaching effects on the landscape and in the lives of the people.

To raise concerns regarding water quality HOME monitored aquatic invertebrates which started in the year 1996. The quality of the water was measured against the following factors:-
temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, turbidity, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli). Most of the factors met the standards. However, few of the factors like phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria were found to be very high. Summary data showing metric for phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria, indicated that the water quality is not appropriate and not biologically supported .Thereby, HOME decided to protect and manage the in-stream habitats.
	
* History and Mission

Homestead Act has been one of the most important legislation in the United States. The very first Homestead was claimed in the Brownville, Nebraska by a resident of Ohio name Daniel Freeman in the year 1863.He is the first homesteader in the nation. Daniel served more than 1000 acres and became one of the prominent resident of Gage County. He proposed the idea of memorizing the place he lived in, on his name. Soon after his death the residents of Beatrice started the agenda of preserving his homestead as National park. Initially the proposal got rejected by the officials but in the year 1934,the resident of Beatrice organized National Homestead Park Association to continue the deed as performed by the Daniel.
The Association could not do much due to funds issue and soon after the America entered into World War || the park visitation and development was suspended.
However, in the year 1950, National park service (NPS) acquired the park and built the visitor center. Gradually there were some positive progress towards the development and in the year 1981, the National Monument had five permanent employees, one part-time and few seasonal employees.
In the 1970’s and 1980’s seasonal rangers demonstrated the history of the Homestead Act. By the early 1990’s, the Homestead Act began to move to other states in the country.

The mission of the organization is to protect and preserve the cultural and natural resources of National Park System. They also believe that it is our responsibility to protect the resources we have today for our next generation. The services extends with other collaborative partners’ to conserve the natural and cultural resources and recreating outdoor across the country
