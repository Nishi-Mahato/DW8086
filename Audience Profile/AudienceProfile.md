### Organization Details
* Homestead National Monument
Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of National Park Service. The National Monument first began as a of part of the National Register of Historic places in the year 1966. The National Monument is 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. The site is now one among the most successfully claimed acres claimed under the Homestead Act. HOME allowed qualified people to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation and improving the property in every possible way. As a result of this act, more than 270 acres of land was turned to individuals volunteering to take off the land. This led to drastic changes in the quality of land which was much needed. The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization and by taking a tour of the interactive museum of American homesteading. Homestead Act holds one of the greatest significance for the westward expansion of the United States. It allows a fair chance to any mankind to claim land for free in exchange of taking care of it keeping it free from contamination, persuading people to take the best care of it the land they live in. The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and in the lives of the people by doing good to the nature we live all in, preserving our resources for the future generation.

* Organization Values/ Mission/Goals
The ultimate goal of the entire Homestead Act is providing free land to people in exchange for asking them to cultivate the land to its best. This agenda helped both mankind and the resources around us. People received land for free to live in and at the same time our natural resources, our land, and water habitats were protected from further contamination. So many families and immigrants flooded more than 10 percent of the land in the US to achieve the ultimate Homestead goal and fulfill the American dream. The goal is to achieve a diverse settlement, agricultural benefits and huge advancement in the field of agriculture. Building nature, renewing our resources to the best for mankind and for future generations to live in.
